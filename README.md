# Welcome
Welcome to the NIEHS CEHJNM Github page. Let the coding begin!

This is a space for everyone involved in Center-related coding activities to come together as a community. Let this be our Center Code Library!

Many of the Center projects and analyses require similar data management steps (whether with the same type of data or not) and may use similar analytic methods. However, individual members and their teams frequently develop scripts and write functions from scratch, even though similar scripts may already exist within the Center. To this end, we established this Center Code Libary, to which Center members and members of their teams can link their project repositories. This resource will allow researchers to find existing code for their analyses and help train all of us in using coding platforms and code sharing. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail the Study Design and Data Science Facility Core Co-Directors, Pam (prf1@cumc.columbia.edu) and Marianthi (mk3961@cumc.columbia.edu).
